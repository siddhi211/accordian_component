# What is an Accordion Component?
An accordion component is a user interface (UI) element that organizes content into collapsible sections. Each section has a header (or title), and clicking the header expands or collapses its associated content. Typically, only one section is open at a time, helping to keep the UI clean and focused.

## Key Features
Collapsible Sections: Content is hidden or shown when the section header is clicked.
Space Saving: Only the relevant content is visible, reducing clutter.
One-at-a-Time (optional): Often, opening one section closes the others, but some accordions allow multiple sections to be open.

## Where is it used?

## Summary:
An accordion component helps organize and present information efficiently by letting users expand or collapse sections as needed.
